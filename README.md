# LCP-finder
An algorithm for checking the existence of LCP-maps between LCL-problems. Input the source and target problems in the files in the input folder in round eliminator format. The output is a map from representative tuples of active source configurations to active target tuples, and can be completed into an LCP-map by permutations.
